                    <p>I'm a self-taught Web Developer that focuses on complex and innovative front-end websites and web applications. I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
                    <p>I have a degree in Physics and Mathematics my love for learning lead me to becoming a teacher. I was a teacher in Japan for close to 4 years. I came to realise that I loved optimizing the learning process for my students and once I had achieved a way of doing that I wanted to change to a field with more opportunites to learn new things.</p>
                    <p>I began my coding journey in 2021 with a bootcamp course from one of the leading schools in Tokyo, Le Wagon. The course aimed at teaching the fundamentals of programming using Ruby on rails or as the teacher elegantly put it “How to become a god in 3 weeks”. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with my newly found godly powers, but I did come out of it with a good understand of the basic concepts of programming and a working understanding of Ruby on rails. </p>
                    <p>I then moved back to Australia to continue more formal education pursing a master’s degree in IT. I took a Web Development course that taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel and MySQL. Ultimately, I found the cost to outweigh the benefits and dropped the master’s course. I’ve since continued my education through online resources and by taking various online courses such as Harvard’s CS50 and Code Academy’s Full-Stack Engineer course. </p>
                    <p>Thanks again for looking into my work! I hope you found this helpful.</p>

                        This project is from the Code Academy website. I was given a design specification document and had to build the design as per the specifications. No solutions are available for this project, and we were encouraged to change some of the specifications to meet our needs. Here is a link to the specifications.
