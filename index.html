                    <p>I'm a self-taught Web Developer that focuses on complex and innovative front-end websites and web applications. I’m glad you stopped by.</p>
                    <p>I’ve written a lot over the years. It can be a little daunting to get into my work, but it doesn’t have to be. Most of my series can be read independently of one another, and although many of them are connected behind the scenes, references to these things are generally easter eggs or other small-scale connections.</p>
                    <p>I thought that here I’d pitch to you a few books—each a good place to start—if you want to dive in. Each book or series I write is usually trying something slightly different, so they each tend to have a unique vibe. The best place for you to start, then, is generally with something that matches your reading tastes. Let me give you a few options. You can click the title of each one to read sample chapters!</p>
                    <p>Thanks again for looking into my work! I hope you found this helpful.</p>
